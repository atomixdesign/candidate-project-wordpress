# Atomix - Trial for Frontend Developers (WordPress and PHP)
### Focusing on: WordPress and PHP skills

## Introduction
This is the second step in our trial for full-stack web developer role who have opted to go for the PHP and WordPress path.\
This trial will test you PHP and WordPress skills additionally to the frontend skills tested in the [previous trial](https://github.com/atomixdesign/candidate-project-html-css).

## Trial Instructions
To complete this trial, you can use your existing HTML and CSS code from the previous trial to setup the atomix theme with this [site design](https://xd.adobe.com/view/9b96df8b-7468-4806-9b66-1a0cd6e30fa4-cec5/). \
Using the [Advanced Custom Field](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/) plugin, create custom fields in the CMS to populate sections of the website to load content dynamically.

Once completed, please email a copy of your database and the uploads folder to review your work.

## Project Setup
I am sure you should already have a decent local environment setup to run PHP site locally, but if required, you can refer to one of these web development environments to setup one depending on our operating system:
1. [WAMP](https://www.wampserver.com/en/)
2. [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/)

## Theme Setup

Refer the [README.md](https://github.com/atomixdesign/candidate-project-wordpress/tree/main/wp-content/themes/atomix) file inside the atomix theme.
